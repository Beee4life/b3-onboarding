# B3 User Registration plugin

This plugin focuses on how to 'onboard' (in other words register/add) users to your site.

You can easily customise a lot of things, if you know your way around [actions/filters](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Hooks). Right now we focus mostly on technique, to make this plugin as customisable as possible. A proper user interface for the less techy will follow later.

### Coming soon
