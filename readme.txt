This plugin styles the default WordPress pages into your own design. It gives you full control over the registration/login process (aka onboarding).

== Description ==

This plugin was built to 'onboard' (in other words register/add) users to your site in the smoothest way possible.

You can customise every aspect of the onboarding process, such as control the look and feel of any email sent out by the website.

There are a ton of things, which you can set through the admin pages or with the help of [actions/filters](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Hooks)

== Installation ==

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Beee4life/b3-onboarding/archive/master.zip).
1. Copy the `b3-onboarding` folder into your `wp-content/plugins` folder.
1. Activate the `B3 OnBoarding` plugin via the plugins admin page. If you run a multisite, it needs to be network activated.
1. (optional) Change any setting you want.
